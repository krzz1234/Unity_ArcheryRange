# Unity_ArcheryRange
 
In this project I have built a simple archery range with a bow, arrows and targets we can shoot.

The purpose of this project is to gain more experience with the Unity Physics Engine and Collision 
Detection methods. 

To move around: use arrow key on your keyboard

To shoot the arrow: click left mouse button
